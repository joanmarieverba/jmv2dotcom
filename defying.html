                            Charlene Griffin never thought she’d be without a home. But when she’s kicked out on her
                            eighteenth birthday, she has no
                            choice but to sleep inside an ominous Victorian mansion. And with the owner offering the
                            estate to anyone who can spend
                            a full night in the haunted property, Charlene decides to risk life and limb to get off the streets.

                            because these ghosts are determined to get rid of her.

                            A ghost needs space to haunt, and a teenager kicked out of the house by a mother unable to
                            love, lacking money for a rental, and looking for a safe place to stay doesn’t have it to offer. But the haunted house
                            offered to Charlene if she can last the night has lost its original family, driven other would-be claimants out by the
                            aggressive late residents, and Charlene is too determined to give up on the only option she’s been able to find.
                            Instead of exorcisms or high-tech spirit guns firing special-effects rays, she tries a simpler method for dealing with ghostly
                            threats: compassion, fueled by stubbornness and courage. Joan Marie Verba’s <em>Defying the Ghosts</em> offers the eerie dangers
                            expected of ghosts, but works through to a slime-less conclusion offering an elegant win to both the living and the
                            dead. &mdash;Ruth Berman, Minnesota Fantasy Award recipient, Midwest Book Award winner for <em>Bradamant's Quest</em>

                    <em>Defying the Ghosts</em> by Joan Marie Verba tells the suspenseful story of a young woman's creepy night in a
                    haunted house. After her mother kicks her out of her house on her eighteenth birthday, Charlene spends the next few weeks
                    scouting homeless shelters and camping out in the back room of the bookstore where she works. Charlene thinks she
                    might be in luck when she hears of a challenge: anyone who can spend the entire night in the local haunted house gets to
                    keep the house. It seems simple enough, but Charlene will soon risk her life on the most horrifying night of her life
                    as she faces the multiple ghosts who do not want anyone else in their home.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    For any reader who is looking for a new kind of horror story, <em>Defying the Ghosts</em> is a great choice for both
                    teens and adults. I never knew it was possible to write a book that was simultaneously terrifying and heartwarming,
                    but Joan Marie Verba has flawlessly managed to do just that. Charlene's story is eye-opening and brings to light the
                    everyday problems and prejudices that...people face when they are trying to survive. The spooky moments of the haunted
                    house are fast-paced, suspenseful, and overall fun to read. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time Charlene was
                    in the house, and I could not put the book down. I can't wait to see what other horror tales Verba has in store.

                <h5>Critic's Report: The BookLife Prize by Publisher's Weekly</h5>
                <p>
                    <strong class="underln">Plot:</strong> Homeless and desperate, eighteen-year-old Charlene Griffin must spend the
                    night alone in a Victorian mansion of
                    terrors in order to earn the right to claim the property as her future home. This YA novel is as much about resiliency
                    as it is about ghosts. The minutiae of Charlene’s situation – being a homeless teen – are described realistically.
                    While spending the night in the haunted house Charlene encounters plenty of snakes, unexplained thuds, disembodied voices,
                    fire, unexpected physical limitations, and, yes, ghosts, which she confronts with intelligence and courage. The
                    ghosts serve to create the terror necessary for a horror story, but they are also metaphors for emotional rites of passage
                    in this hero’s quest for autonomy and maturity.<br />

                    <strong class="underln">Prose/Style:</strong> This is an easy read for anyone with middle school reading abilities,
                    and the action and huge cast of
                    ghosts and their histories makes the novel interesting.... <br />

                    <strong class="underln">Originality:</strong> This novel is remarkable for its non-sentimental treatment of teen
                    homelessness... . It is also an
                    exposition on children and parents, what parents’ obligations to their children are, and what happens when parents
                    fail
                    to meet those responsibilities.<br />

                    <strong class="underln">Character Development/Execution:</strong> Charlene is an utterly believable and sympathetic
                    character whose willingness to face
                    her difficult situation and do what is necessary to deal with it is admirable. She is a great role model for
                    preteens
                    and early teens.<br />

                        <h4>Charlene knew the task would not be easy. She interviewed those who had tried and failed
                            before her. She looked up the
                            history of the house and its residents. She thought she was prepared. But she had no idea of
                            the challenges ahead of
                            her.
