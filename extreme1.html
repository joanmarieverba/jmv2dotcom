            <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>Gordon Tracy knelt on the beach, reaching for the Bombastic missile launcher. He balanced it against his
                    thigh, checking
                    to be sure that the missile was firmly in place inside the tube. Using both hands, he hefted the
                    launcher to his shoulder,
                    adjusted the targeting sight to his eye, and found Thunderbird 1. The rocket-reconnaissance vessel with
                    the silver fuselage
                    and red tip streaked across the sky. Even though Thunderbird 1 traveled well past the speed of sound,
                    the targeting control
                    pinpointed and followed it. Gordon hit the launch button. The recoil shoved him back into the sand as
                    the missile shot
                    out of the tube and into the air.
                </p>
                <p> Quickly, Gordon set the launcher down stood watching as the missile approached its target, idly brushing
                    sand off his
                    arms and legs. Thunderbird 1 wavered in its course in an evasive maneuver, but the missile dipped and
                    soared with it,
                    rapidly closing in. When Thunderbird 1 turned, it turned to follow.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Good grief, Gordon, that&#39;s going to blast Thunderbird 1 right out of the sky!&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon glanced back to see his tall, platinum-blond older brother John standing behind him, also
                    following the missile&#39;s
                    flight. &#34;That&#39;s the idea,&#34; Gordon said, grinning.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Can&#39;t you do something, Brains?&#34; Jeff Tracy, Gordon&#39;s father, turned to the younger man
                    next to him, who was frantically
                    working the dials and levers of a radio emitter unit, used for jamming or disrupting homing devices.
                </p>
                <p> Brains lifted a hand in frustration. &#34;I&#39;m t-t-rying everything I can, Mr. Tracy. Nothing&#39;s
                    working!&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon raised an arm and pointed. &#34;Look now, fellas, or you&#39;ll miss the best part.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> The missile struck Thunderbird 1, shattering it amidst a blinding fireball. Seconds later, a thunderous
                    BOOM rolled
                    over the beach at Tracy Island. In the distance, they could see silvery bits reflecting the sunlight as
                    they rained down
                    towards the ocean below.
                </p>
                <p> Scott&#39;s eyes widened. &#34;Wow! If I&#39;d been piloting Thunderbird 1, my goose would have been
                    cooked for sure.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Jeff let out a heavy sigh and spoke into a hand-held microphone. &#34;Okay, Virgil, come on back.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Virgil&#39;s voice came over the speaker. &#34;I did everything I could, Dad. I just couldn&#39;t shake
                    it.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I know. We saw,&#34; Jeff said dejectedly.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Even at a distance ahead of it, I felt the explosion,&#34; Virgil said. &#34;Thunderbird 2 is
                    undamaged, but that shock wave
                    was pretty powerful. The Thunderbird 1 model was shredded. Nothing left of the tow cable, either. It was
                    incinerated
                    as far as I can tell.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon could see the green, beetle-shaped Thunderbird 2 heavy-rescue aircraft heading toward the Tracy
                    Island runway.
                    <br /> Scott turned to Jeff. &#34;Aren&#39;t we going to try to recover the target?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Nothing left to recover, as I see it,&#34; John said.
                </p>
                <p> Jeff shook his head. &#34;As far as I&#39;m concerned, we found out what we needed to know: if that new
                    Bombastic rocket launcher
                    could destroy a model of Thunderbird 1, with the same adamantium-cahelium fuselage, it could destroy the
                    real one, too.
                    Unless Brains needs the debris for study&#8230;?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Brains adjusted his glasses. &#34;N-n-no, Mr. Tracy, I don&#39;t need the model anymore.&#34; He
                    extended a hand to Gordon. &#34;What
                    I do need to s-s-study is that rocket launcher so I can find a way to defeat the technology.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon reached down, picked it up, brushed sand off the bottom of the launcher, and handed it to Brains.
                    &#34;That&#39;s what
                    I got it for.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Jeff gestured up the hill. &#34;Let&#39;s go back to the villa.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Tracy Villa, the residence they had all built, stood at the highest point of the small island. It not
                    only housed Jeff,
                    his five sons, and Brains, but also Jeff&#39;s mother, Jeff&#39;s best friend Kyrano, and his daughter
                    Tin-Tin. The structure
                    included the living quarters&#8212;bedrooms, study, kitchen, laundry&#8212;Brains&#39;s labs, and many
                    of the support facilities for
                    International Rescue, the organization to which they all belonged.
                </p>
                <p> As they walked up the hill, the sound of ramjets grew ever louder as Thunderbird 2 approached the
                    runway. A rock slab,
                    part of the cliff at the end of the runway, went up in response to Virgil&#39;s signal, exposing the
                    hangar built into the
                    cave inside the cliff.
                </p>
                <p> Square-jawed Scott touched Gordon&#39;s arm and pointed to the rocket launcher Brains carried.
                    &#34;Where did you get that,
                    anyway?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Richard Nygaard,&#34; Gordon said. &#34;We were in the aquanaut corps together.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Were?&#34; John asked.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;He left when his enlistment was up to get a job on land.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;As an arms dealer?&#34; Scott asked.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon shook his head. &#34;He&#39;s a reporter for Ares Monthly. It&#39;s a magazine for weapons
                    experts. The public can subscribe
                    to it&#8212;I read every issue cover to cover&#8212;but it&#39;s also read by people who work in the
                    military industrial complex and
                    government defense offices.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;&#8230;as well as renegade illicit arms dealers and gun runners,&#34; Jeff added.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon shrugged. &#34;Inevitably, yes.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;So how did a reporter get a piece of the latest high-tech weaponry for you?&#34; John asked.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;He goes to weapons shows all the time. The magazine&#39;s correspondents buy and bring back the
                    merchandise to the main
                    offices to photograph and analyze. You should see their display room.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I can imagine,&#34; Jeff grumbled.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon smiled. &#34;When I read about this little item, I thought it might be something we needed to
                    know about, so I asked
                    Richard to buy an extra for me. I&#39;m a licensed collector with a security clearance from when I was
                    in the corps, so we
                    were able to clear the government red tape for me to get it fairly easily.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Who&#39;s making it?&#34; Jeff asked.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;A munitions plant in Maurinia,&#34; Gordon said.
                </p>
                <p> Scott raised an eyebrow. &#34;The country where there&#39;s no functioning government right now.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;WorldGov is in negotiations to set one up,&#34; John said, &#34;There&#39;s a government-in-exile
                    organizing a congress.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I hope they succeed,&#34; Gordon said. &#34;After their former leader died, the country split into
                    factions and fought against
                    each other. A lot of people fled. One strongman took over and invited a bunch of robber barons in to set
                    up shop. Then
                    they deposed the strongman and set up their own small fiefdoms. It&#39;s a paradise for gun runners and
                    illicit arms makers
                    right now.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;WorldGov is putting a lot of pressure on them,&#34; John said. &#34;Hopefully the people there will
                    get relief soon.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I ran a Fortune 500 company for many years&#8230;,&#34; Jeff began.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Made the Ã«Best Companies to Work for in the U.S.&#39; list seven years in a row,&#34; John
                    interrupted proudly.
                </p>
                <p> Jeff continued, &#34;&#8230;and I&#39;m all for capitalism, but you can&#39;t run a nation the way you
                    run a corporation, and these
                    gun runners couldn&#39;t manage a lemonade stand, much less a company, and even less a country.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;The way they&#39;re going, these particular robber barons will eventually run their enterprises
                    right into the ground,&#34;
                    John added.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;As bad as it is,&#34; Jeff said, &#34;International Rescue can&#39;t interfere in government
                    disputes; the politicians seem to
                    be working hard on this matter, and there are signs it will eventually lead to a peaceful solution. What
                    I&#39;m worried
                    about is that, in the meantime, this is on the open market, anyone can get it and aim it at us.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Or use it to cause a disaster where we have to go and rescue people,&#34; John added.
                </p>
                <p> Jeff nodded. &#34;In any case, we have to make it a priority to find a way to neutralize it.&#34; He
                    turned to his fourth son,
                    reached back, and patted him on the shoulder. &#34;Good work, Gordon.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Thanks, Dad.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> They reached the lower level of Tracy Villa, which looked out on the swimming pool. Taking the stairs,
                    they reached
                    the main level and proceeded to the lounge, which doubled as Jeff&#39;s office and the control center
                    for the International
                    Rescue organization.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I&#39;ll s-s-start analyzing this right away, Mr. Tracy,&#34; Brains said, and left for his lab.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I&#39;ll join you, Brains,&#34; John said.
                </p>
                <p> Jeff nodded and sat at his desk. Scott sat at the chessboard, inviting Gordon to play with a gesture.
                    Gordon smiled,
                    nodded, and sat. Soon, Virgil, second oldest after Scott, entered and walked over to Jeff&#39;s desk.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Dad, there was a short in Thunderbird 2&#39;s electrical system. I think the shock from the
                    explosion must have affected
                    the generator.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Jeff turned to him. &#34;Serious?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;No. I&#39;ve already repaired it. Only took me a few minutes. But I had to recharge and
                    reboot&#8230;that should take three
                    to four hours, at most.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Jeff nodded. &#34;Okay. Thanks, Virgil. Good work.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Virgil walked the brief distance to the baby grand piano and started to play lounge tunes. Virgil was
                    the most muscular
                    of Jeff&#39;s five sons, and the most talented in music and art.
                </p>
                <p> As the chess game and the music both went on, Gordon kept an eye on the hallway leading to Brains&#39;s
                    lab. Earlier in
                    the day, he had set a bead-sized holographic projector in the ceiling just outside the lab, and when
                    they all went outside
                    so they could see the rocket launcher test, he activated it. The projector gave the illusion that the
                    door had disappeared
                    and only a blank wall was there. To make the deception complete, he had covered the door with a
                    rectangular piece of
                    balsa wood the same size, painted white like the wall, so that if anyone doubted the illusion, they
                    could not find the
                    door by feel. Gordon smiled, awaiting the hilarious moment when Brains and John would realize that they
                    had been tricked
                    and come storming back into the lounge, outraged.
                </p>
                <p> Minutes passed, however, and the house remained quiet, except for Virgil&#39;s soothing background
                    music. Gordon turned
                    more of his concentration to the chess game, challenging Scott to a greater degree. Perhaps Brains and
                    John had immediately
                    recognized the deception, found the projector, and removed the balsa wood door cover. For Gordon, that
                    would work, too.
                    Whenever he played a practical joke, his brothers nearly always retaliated in kind, sooner or later.
                    Between chess moves,
                    he wondered what creative response they would come up with. Like Gordon&#39;s pranks, his brothers&#39;
                    reactions were always
                    harmless, never mean-spirited&#8212;but they were fun!
                </p>
                <p> In addition to his passion for all things aquatic, and his fascination with weaponry, Gordon felt it was
                    his duty to
                    make the world a more lighthearted place. When he was a small boy, he would tease his mother by hiding
                    her keys or buttons
                    or other small items. Always, she would come to him and say with a smile, &#34;Now, Gordon, where are my
                    keys?&#34; and Gordon
                    would always get them for her. Her smile was his reward. Once, he overheard his father grumbling to his
                    mother that Gordon
                    was becoming too frivolous. His mother said that their little red-headed Gordon was just spirited,
                    pointing out how hard
                    he worked in school and at his swimming lessons, and besides, he was smaller than his other brothers,
                    and simply needed
                    to feel important, as everyone did. His father reluctantly agreed with her at first, and then, as his
                    mother charmed
                    him further, conceded her point. Mother was always good at getting Jeff to agree with her, and ending up
                    thinking it
                    was his idea.
                </p>
                <p> After she died, they had all mourned for her, of course. Days passed, and everyone was just
                    so&#8230;serious. He knew
                    his mother would not want them to be unhappy for the rest of their lives. She had taught him a few
                    simple card tricks,
                    and as he got older, he read books on magic and magicians. With his mother gone, it seemed only natural
                    for him to start
                    cheering everyone up by making things seem to appear and disappear. Soon everyone was in a better mood,
                    and Gordon made
                    sure that whenever they started to get sad, or too serious, that he was there to remedy the situation.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Checkmate!&#34; Scott announced with a grin, and Gordon nodded. The fun for him was in playing and
                    getting attention, not
                    necessarily in winning.
                </p>
                <p> A beep drew their attention to the wall, causing Virgil to stop playing in mid-stanza. Portraits of each
                    of the five
                    Tracy sons hung on the panel opposite Jeff&#39;s desk. These images, however, were made up of pixels,
                    not paint. The eyes
                    of the youngest Tracy brother, Alan, lit up and flashed, alerting them to a message.
                </p>
                <p> Jeff flipped a switch at his desk console. &#34;Go ahead, Alan.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> The portrait of Alan in his International Rescue uniform&#8212;teal jumpsuit, matching garrison cap,
                    white sash&#8212;became a live
                    picture of Alan standing in the control room of Thunderbird 5, the communications satellite in
                    geosynchronous orbit over
                    Tracy Island. &#34;Father, I&#39;ve picked up a distress signal from the science ship Deep Sea Meridian.
                    It was dredging samples
                    from the ocean bottom and apparently an old mine left over from one of the Pacific wars came loose and
                    exploded near
                    them. The cable to a diving bell broke, and it sank to the bottom of the ocean. There&#39;s a crack in
                    the hull and they&#39;re
                    taking on water. The ship&#39;s okay, but there&#39;s no cable on their winch now. They can&#39;t
                    retrieve the diving bell, and conventional
                    rescue can&#39;t get there fast enough.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon rushed to Jeff&#39;s desk and leaned over a map projection on the surface. &#34;Where, Alan?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;About 100 kilometers west-southwest of Tracy Island.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon looked over to Jeff. &#34;That&#39;s close enough for me to get there directly on Thunderbird
                    4.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Virgil stood from the piano. &#34;I might be able to take Gordon there on Thunderbird 2 that short
                    distance on partial power.&#34;
                    <br /> Jeff shook his head. &#34;No, I&#39;m not risking it. If something went wrong with Thunderbird 2,
                    we might not be able to get
                    there in time. Gordon&#39;s right: the fastest, surest way there is for him to go alone on Thunderbird
                    4.&#34; He turned to Gordon.
                    &#34;Gordon, emergency launch. Go!&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Yes, sir.&#34; Gordon raced to the access elevator. This quickly descended to the hangar for
                    Thunderbird 2, which shared
                    its space with the submarine Thunderbird 4 and other rescue vehicles. Normally, a semi-circular pod with
                    Thunderbird
                    4 inside would be locked to the frame of Thunderbird 2. Then Thunderbird 2 would carry Thunderbird 4 to
                    the danger zone.
                    The emergency launch procedure, however, required only the submarine. Once Gordon reached the hangar
                    floor, he touched
                    the controls that opened the stone door. While the gears ground noisily, he entered pod 4 and climbed
                    into the submarine.
                    Quickly, he changed into his International Rescue uniform: a teal jumpsuit and matching garrison cap
                    similar to Alan&#39;s,
                    except that his sash was orange. He sat in the pilot&#39;s seat and opened the pod door by remote
                    control.
                </p>
                <p> Thunderbird 4 rolled out of the pod, onto the runway, and toward the dock at the end of the runway. When
                    he reached
                    the dock, it tilted downward and Thunderbird 4 slid into the water with a splash. Once submerged, Gordon
                    hit the thrusters
                    lightly, descending to normal cruise level. Using the data Alan had sent to the submarine&#39;s GPS
                    unit, he plotted a course.
                    After checking the readouts, he put a hand firmly on the accelerator control lever and gradually pushed
                    it to maximum.
                    Brains had installed the same atomic fusion engines in Thunderbird 4 as he had in Thunderbirds 1 and 2.
                    Because water
                    was denser than air, Thunderbird 4 could not match the supersonic speeds of the aircraft, but it could
                    reach 160 knots,
                    making it the fastest vessel on or under the sea.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon called Alan. &#34;Alan, do you have communication with the diving bell?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Patching you through. Go ahead.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Diving bell Deep Sea Meridian, this is International Rescue. I&#39;ll be there within a half hour.
                    Please update your situation.&#34;
                    <br /> &#34;This is Professor Lassiter of Maritime University. We&#39;re taking on water.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon heard a rushing sound in the background. &#34;How fast?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Right now, the water is over our ankles, and it&#39;s still coming in. At this depth, the force of
                    the water is pummeling
                    the inside of the bell like a sand blaster. We&#39;re staying out of its way.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;How many in your diving bell?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Me and two of my students.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;What model is the diving bell?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;It&#39;s a SeaBella 1162.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;You should have enough air until I get there. I&#39;m less than a half hour away.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Thanks, but if the crack widens, that may not be enough time.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I know. Do you have breathing apparatus with you?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;We do, but the water&#39;s cold. I&#39;m worried about hypothermia if we get too waterlogged.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Wrap up with whatever you have and put the breathing masks on now. I expect to be there before you
                    or your students
                    lose consciousness due to lack of air or hypothermia.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Will do, International Rescue, but the air pressure&#39;s rising with all this water displacing the
                    air. Our ears have
                    already started popping. We may need a decompression chamber if we ever get out of this.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon sighed. He had experienced a case of the bends himself early in his aquanaut career, and
                    remembered how excruciating
                    it was. Some divers, having suffered from the bends once, vowed to kill themselves before they would go
                    through it again.
                    &#34;I know. I&#39;m sorry. But treatment for the bends is much better even when I had it years
                    ago.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Oh, don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re not going to do anything drastic. One of my students has a pregnant
                    wife, I have a worried one,
                    and the other student just got engaged. But please get here as fast as you can!&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I&#39;m coming toward you at full throttle. Watch for my lights!&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon kept his eyes on the view in front of him as he sped toward the diving bell. Water rushed over
                    and around the
                    submarine, pushing everything that swam near aside. Sensors confirmed the tremendous wake trailing
                    behind. Thunderbird
                    4&#39;s small size and sleek design facilitated its headlong rush to its destination.
                </p>
                <p> Presently, long-range sonar detected the Deep Sea Meridian on the surface. Slowly, Gordon reduced speed
                    and started
                    to descend. The submarine made its best time at the upper levels of the ocean, where the water was the
                    least dense. As
                    water pressure increased with depth, the top speed Thunderbird 4 was able to achieve decreased.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;How are you doing, Professor?&#34; Gordon called.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Shivering. The water is almost up to our armpits.&#34; The voice was muffled; he had to be wearing
                    a breathing mask.
                    <br /> &#34;Almost there,&#34; Gordon reassured him. &#34;I&#39;ve turned on my beacon; you should see
                    it soon.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Seconds later, the sonar detected the diving bell. The SeaBella 1162 had been built to withstand even
                    the enormous pressure
                    at the bottom of the ocean. Gordon&#39;s guess was that it took the mine explosion to even put a crack
                    in it, and that the
                    crack had not widened because the bell had been constructed to hold together despite the greatest
                    stresses. In fact,
                    Thunderbird 4 and the SeaBella 1162 were two of only a limited number of vessels that could stay
                    together at such depths.
                    <br /> &#34;I see your light,&#34; the professor called.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;And I see you,&#34; Gordon called back. He checked the area around the diving bell; it had not
                    tangled in old netting or
                    other debris which commonly presented a hazard on the sea bottom. Reducing speed to minimum, he floated
                    close enough
                    to nudge the bell slightly, and found it moved: not stuck, then.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;What was that?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Just me,&#34; Gordon said sheepishly; he probably should have warned the professor before the
                    nudge. &#34;I&#39;ll have you out
                    in a minute.&#34; Thunderbird 4 had two robot arms, called &#34;grabs.&#34; The SeaBella 1162 had been
                    designed with four handles
                    that a robot arm could latch on to, as a safety measure. Gordon picked the nearest point and extended an
                    arm in that
                    direction. The pincers at the end closed on the handle and locked in place. He tested the connection by
                    raising Thunderbird
                    4 slightly; the diving bell moved with it. Through his windshield, he could see the bell&#39;s
                    observation window, and through
                    that, the three people, who were indeed up to their armpits in water. They looked back and wriggled
                    their fingers; he
                    smiled, waved, and held up a thumb, gesturing upward. He emptied the ballast tanks and they rose as a
                    unit.
                </p>
                <p> He found the ship&#39;s crew waiting when they surfaced. Four of the crew rowed toward them in a
                    lifeboat; two quickly pulled
                    themselves onto the diving bell and opened the top hatch. They helped the professor and his students up
                    and into the
                    lifeboat. All waved at Gordon, who watched through the Thunderbird 4 windshield; he waved back as he
                    retracted the grabs.
                    The crew rowed back to the cables that had lowered the lifeboat into the water and re-attached them to
                    the frame. Then
                    the ship raised the lifeboat back to the deck.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon opened communications to Thunderbird 5 and Tracy Island. &#34;Mission accomplished. Diving bell
                    occupants safely
                    returned to the ship.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Good work, Gordon!&#34; Jeff said.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Heading home,&#34; Gordon said, and closed the connection.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon set course for Tracy Island, proceeding at a more leisurely pace. Descending to normal cruise
                    depth, he took
                    the time to gauge the condition of the ocean in this area. He noted both the clarity of the water, which
                    seemed free
                    of debris and pollutants, and the kinds and numbers of aquatic animals. The fish looked healthy. Schools
                    swimming by
                    seemed amply populated, and Gordon saw a variety of species as he traveled along. A couple of young,
                    robust sperm whales
                    investigated Thunderbird 4, and when the yellow submarine demonstrated no interest in playing, moved on.
                    Gordon smiled.
                    The world&#39;s conservation efforts, accelerated in the past half century, had produced excellent
                    results. Even from the
                    time he spent several months underwater as a member of the aquanaut corps, only a few years back, he had
                    observed significant
                    improvements.
                </p>
                <p> Eventually long-range sonar spotted Tracy Island and the nearby Mateo Island, both tops of extinct
                    volcanoes rooted
                    on the ocean floor, both privately owned by Jeff Tracy. Gordon guided Thunderbird 4 to the dock, which
                    tilted downward
                    at his electronic command. Thunderbird 4 scooted up the ramp, onto the runway, and back to the hangar.
                    The stone hangar
                    door opened for him and closed behind him at his signal.
                </p>
                <p> Once he had tucked Thunderbird 4 into pod 4, Gordon changed back into his civilian clothes. He favored
                    high-collared
                    shirts or turtlenecks with pants or jeans. Today he wore his favorite green shirt over black pants.
                    Leaving the pod,
                    and closing the access door behind him, he turned to walk across the floor to the elevator.
                </p>
                <p> It was not there.
                </p>
                <p> Puzzled, he scratched his head. Looking up, he saw the stage lights mounted in the stone ceiling that
                    illuminated the
                    hangar. The big, green, Thunderbird 2 aircraft was there, frame raised on stilts, ready to lower onto a
                    pod delivered
                    by the conveyor belt underneath. So&#8230; Gordon extended an arm. If Thunderbird 2 was there, and pod 4
                    was there, the
                    passenger elevator should be&#8230;here. Except he saw only a blank wall. The elevator could not have
                    moved, could it?
                    <br /> Looking up again, he took an inventory of the hangar entrances and exits. An observation walkway
                    in the back wall, well
                    above Thunderbird 2, had a door leading to Tracy Villa. The inspection monorail, which traveled to and
                    through all the
                    hangars&#8212;Thunderbird 2&#39;s, Thunderbird 1&#39;s, and the space rocket Thunderbird
                    3&#39;s&#8212;also had a platform above him. The retractable
                    slide that Virgil used to go from the lounge to the hangar had been fully collapsed into the ceiling, as
                    it should have
                    been when not in use. The passenger elevator, which went from just outside the lounge directly to
                    Thunderbird 2, also
                    had retracted. This left the access elevator that went from the hangar floor to Tracy Villa&#8230;in
                    theory, anyway.
                    <br /> Gordon turned again to where he thought it should be. Nothing. Slowly, delicately, he extended a
                    hand, palm up, and
                    pressed it gingerly against the blank wall. Wood. Moving his hand side to side, the feeling remained the
                    same: wood,
                    painted wood. Strange, because little or no wood had been used in building the hangars. Nearly all the
                    materials had
                    been high-tech alloys, metal, or foams.
                </p>
                <p> Suddenly, the thought entered his mind: of course! This was payback for his practical joke! They hid the
                    elevator doors
                    from him. Gordon began to chuckle, then laughed out loud. This was hilarious! He sank to the floor, too
                    weak from laughing
                    to stand. If Brains and his brothers had popped out of hiding places, shouting &#34;Gotcha!&#34; he
                    would not have been surprised.
                    But they did not. Just as his brothers generally said nothing when he played a joke on them, Gordon
                    usually said nothing
                    when they retaliated. Life simply went on&#8230;just as it should.
                </p>
                <p> Although he could feel the wood covering the elevator door, he could not see it, so they must have put a
                    hologram in
                    place to give the illusion of a blank wall. When he finally picked himself up off the floor, he first
                    looked for a projector
                    to turn it off. Seeing none nearby, he guessed it had to be mounted into the ceiling, out of reach. He
                    could have tried
                    to find it with the electronic sensor equipment in the hangar, but, at last, he decided not to take the
                    elevator after
                    all. An access door had been built into the stone wall next to the hangar. Gordon simply went out that
                    way, climbed the
                    hill, and walked up the stairs into Tracy Villa.
                </p>
                <p> When he reached the lounge, he saw John and Brains at a demonstration board, showing Jeff, Scott, and
                    Virgil their analysis
                    of the rocket launcher. They all turned to him.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Elevator broken?&#34; Jeff asked.
                </p>
                <p> Perhaps his father had not been wise to the joke or the retaliation. That sometimes happened. &#34;No, I
                    just wanted to
                    stretch my legs,&#34; Gordon said.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Good exercise?&#34; John asked with a knowing smile.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon grinned. &#34;Pays to be fit.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Okay, boys.&#34; Jeff gestured to the demonstration board. &#34;Let&#39;s get on with the
                    presentation.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> The demonstration board was a smartboard with a touchscreen. Brains orchestrated the images with hand
                    gestures. &#34;What
                    John and I f-f-found is that the warhead has been p-p-programmed with multiple ways to seek a target. In
                    addition to
                    heat-seeking capabilities, there&#39;s a laser-guided system and the equivalent of facial recognition.
                    That allows it to
                    lock on to the appearance of a target in three dimensions, so that no m-m-matter which way it turns, the
                    missile continues
                    to follow.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Wow,&#34; Scott said, &#34;all that in one small warhead.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Brains turned to him. &#34;Nanotechnology has allowed manufacturers to p-p-pack in quite a bit of
                    sophistication in addition
                    to the explosives within a missile.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Jeff tapped a finger on his desk. &#34;So, how do we defeat it? We already have defenses against
                    heat-seeking weapons and
                    laser guidance systems. Would a holographic projection work? You know, like the ones you and the boys
                    use to play practical
                    jokes on each other.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Silence followed. The Tracy sons and Brains looked from one to the other sheepishly.
                </p>
                <p> Eventually, Gordon laughed. &#34;It&#39;s certainly something we can try, Dad, since we all know how to
                    make a holographic illusion.&#34;
                    <br /> Brains had his lips pressed together, but when Gordon lightened the mood, he said, &#34;I would
                    s-s-suggest placing a stationary
                    target on the rocks at the edge of Mateo Island and test firing from here.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> They took the better part of the afternoon setting up a target. Brains quickly programmed a holographic
                    projector while
                    Gordon found a suitable wooden crate to use as a target. Although the Tracys had a yacht in a pen on the
                    other side of
                    Tracy Island, they normally used a 30-foot speedboat with an outboard motor to go to the storage caves
                    on Mateo Island.
                    Scott, Brains, and Gordon loaded the boat and pushed off.
                </p>
                <p> While Gordon drove the boat, Scott pointed to the crate. &#34;I see you added an artistic touch.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon smiled. He had spray-painted a bull&#39;s-eye with a face in the middle, sticking out its tongue.
                    &#34;Not as artistic
                    as Virgil would have made it, but it gives me something to aim at.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;How many warheads do we have to spare?&#34; Scott asked.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;I got four with the rocket launcher, so we have three left.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Scott turned from Gordon to Brains. &#34;That should be enough to test any defenses, shouldn&#39;t
                    it?&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;P-p-provided we find the solution quickly,&#34; Brains said.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon turned slightly from his perch at the boat&#39;s steering wheel. &#34;I don&#39;t think I could
                    get more, at least through
                    normal channels. The government guys at import-export let me take four warheads as a collector and
                    retired servicemember
                    with a security clearance, and because I live on an isolated island, but they gave me a hard time even
                    then.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Scott turned to Brains. &#34;Meaning he used all of his Gordon Tracy charm to get them.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon grinned. &#34;If we need more than that, we&#39;d have to go to an arms show outside normal
                    channels.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Black market, you mean,&#34; Scott said.
                </p>
                <p> Gordon waved a hand. &#34;Gray market, at the most, and I would have to bypass customs on the way
                    home.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Not impossible, but not easy,&#34; Scott said.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Right.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> When they arrived at Mateo Island, Gordon tied up the boat while Scott and Brains unloaded it. They
                    found a suitable
                    boulder at the shoreline away from the storage caves, and firmly parked the crate on top of it.
                </p>
                <p> Once back on Tracy Island, the Tracy men and Brains stood on the beach, looking toward the target.
                    Brains took out his
                    remote control while the others used binoculars to get a better view. As they watched, the crate seemed
                    to turn into
                    a moving carousel with brightly-painted horses.
                </p>
                <p> &#34;Now that ought to confuse it!&#34; Scott said.
                </p>
                <p> Brains turned off the projector. &#34;Go a-a-ahead, Gordon.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> Gordon sighted the crate and turned on the targeting so that the warhead could get a bearing. &#34;Okay,
                    Brains, whenever
                    you&#39;re ready.&#34;
                </p>
                <p> &#34;At my m-m-mark,&#34; Brains said. &#34;Five, four, three, t-t-wo, one. Fire!&#34;
                </p>
                <p> They heard a swish as the warhead left the launcher. The crate turned into the carousel. A heartbeat
                    later the boulder
                    shattered into a million tiny pieces as the warhead hit the target and exploded in a ball of flame.
                </p>
                <p> John sighed. &#34;Back to the drawing board.&#34;</p>
