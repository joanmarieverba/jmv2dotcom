            </div>
            <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>The star disappeared. Something had unexpectedly moved in front of it; John Tracy kept watching to find
                    out what that something was. Whenever an unknown object came between Earth and a star, occulting it, that could lead to a new
                    discovery. He avoided the mistake he had made as a student astronomer: on that earlier night, he had drawn his head back from
                    the virtual eyepiece in surprise, missing the best part of the occultation. More experienced now, he maintained his
                    concentration. Smiling, he remembered that the camera was recording: he would be able to review the event later. He kept
                    watching nonetheless; he always found a live event more exciting than a recorded one, and the virtual eyepiece provided a
                    high-resolution image faster than the camera.</p>
                <p>He could not immediately determine what had blocked his view of the star. The object he had momentarily
                    taken his eye off of, as a student, had turned out to be a new comet. Despite his error, he had been the first to see and
                    report it, and Comet Tracy had made a satisfying display in the night sky as it had passed Earth on the way to the Sun,
                    which had drawn it in with its gravity and made an end of it.</p>
                <p>This object, however, was too dim to be a comet, even a comet at a great distance from the sun. Perhaps
                    it was a passing meteor? No, it was too slow to be a meteor. The star was taking a long time to reappear. Wait, there it
                    was again! John grinned. This would be a major discovery; no objects, except for the star he had originally sighted, had
                    ever been charted in this region of space.</p>
                <p>The star winked out again. John&#8217;s jaw dropped. Whatever the object was, other objects must be
                    orbiting around it. The star appeared again quickly, meaning that the second object had to be considerably smaller than the
                    first. John kept looking. The star winked, meaning yet another, even smaller object, and then dimmed an instant,
                    indicating a relatively tiny object.</p>
                <p>After another half hour, the star remained steady. John kept the camera on, but finally drew back from
                    the telescope&#8217;s virtual eyepiece. He rubbed his neck; it had become a bit stiff from the stargazing. Quickly, hands
                    shaking with excitement, he pulled out the recording disk from the camera and inserted a fresh one. He carefully labeled the disk
                    with the date, Greenwich Mean Time, and the right ascension and declination, which gave its position in the sky. Then
                    he inserted the disk into the computer.</p>
                <p>This computer had the latest in astronomy software. John watched two computer monitors: one showed the
                    visual, the other showed the results from the spectrometer, which analyzed the light. Another window opened, giving
                    additional data such as velocity and direction. Viewing all of the readouts, John raised both arms in a silent display of
                    triumph. The preliminary
                    results showed that he had discovered either a tremendously large gas giant planet or a brown dwarf star
                    passing the solar system on its way around the galaxy, dragging a set of satellites with it.</p>
                <p>With deliberate care, John organized the data for transmission to the International Astronomical Union.
                    He entered his name as &#8220;astronomer,&#8221; and &#8220;Tracy Orbiting Observatory&#8221; as the origin of the data.
                    Fortunately, no
                    one found it strange that billionaire ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy had purchased a state-of-the-art telescope
                    for his third
                    son and sent it into space. What the public did not know, however, was that this telescope was a part of
                    Thunderbird 5, International Rescue&#8217;s secret communications satellite, in geosynchronous orbit above Tracy
                    Island, International
                    Rescue&#8217;s hidden base in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>John took the datacard from the computer and walked from the astrodome to the Thunderbird 5&#8217;s
                    communications center.
                    The enormous satellite&#8217;s artificial gravity kept him steady as he descended to that level. Once
                    there, he inserted
                    the datacard into the central computer, the one with the fastest Internet connection, found the
                    IAU&#8217;s website,
                    and transmitted the information. When the IAU&#8217;s computer acknowledged receipt, he sat down on the
                    adjustable chair
                    and looked out the panoramic window at Earth.</p>
                <p>Although he could see the Pacific Ocean, Tracy Island itself was too small to be seen from space by the
                    naked eye. One of
                    the monitors, however, showed the image from another telescope on Thunderbird 5, which gave a clearer,
                    sharper picture
                    than any military spy satellite. He had focused that on Tracy Island, and he could see the house that he
                    and his four
                    brothers had built, Tracy Villa. The pool next to it was empty; none of his family swam in it at the
                    moment. What he
                    could not see were the underground hangars which held the aircraft he and his brothers used for rescues.
                    The rocket-reconnaissance
                    craft, Thunderbird 1, normally piloted by his eldest brother, Scott Tracy, stood in a hangar next to the
                    villa. Its launch
                    pad was under the pool, which slid aside to let Thunderbird 1 rocket into the sky when needed.
                    Thunderbird 2, the heavy-rescue
                    aircraft, rested in a hangar in an enormous cave underneath a building they called Cliff House. His
                    next-eldest brother,
                    Virgil, usually piloted that one. Sharing the Thunderbird 2 hangar was Thunderbird 4, the compact but
                    powerful submarine
                    operated by his younger brother, Gordon. The space rocket, Thunderbird 3&#8217;s, hangar lay underneath
                    the donut-shaped
                    building they called the Round House. The day before, he had launched Thunderbird 3 through the donut
                    hole and guided
                    it to Thunderbird 5, where it currently resided in the docking tube.</p>
                <p>After he and his father and brothers built Tracy Island and organized International Rescue, satellite
                    duty had been split
                    between him and his youngest brother, Alan. Each was to serve one month on Thunderbird 5 and the next
                    month at Tracy
                    Villa, helping with the rescues on Earth. This was a month where John had been scheduled to stay on
                    Tracy Island, but
                    Alan came down with the flu only a few days after switching with John, and now slept in his room on
                    Thunderbird 5. Jeff
                    had sent John up in Thunderbird 3 to take over monitoring duties until Alan recovered.</p>
                <p>John stood from the chair and let out a long, satisfied breath. Again, he looked out the window. The
                    words &#8220;International
                    Rescue&#8221; had been set in metallic letters over the pane, though those letters did not obstruct the
                    view to any great
                    extent. Since childhood, his dream had been to live in space. As a young boy, every time his father came
                    home from space,
                    he would listen eagerly as Jeff related every detail&#8230;along with his brothers, who seemed no less
                    interested. After
                    his mother died, his father retired from the astronaut corps and founded Tracy Technologies, which
                    provided supplies
                    and construction equipment for the moonbase. The central part of the moonbase took years to build, and
                    expansion projects
                    continued years after that. At the time John earned his degrees, the core of the moonbase was still
                    incomplete. While
                    Scott served in the Air Force, Gordon in the aquanaut corps, and Alan in the Grand Prix race car
                    circuit, John and Virgil
                    joined their father at the company, and regularly traveled to the Moon and back. The two brothers
                    supervised and participated
                    in the ongoing construction, though the time they spent there decreased, and then ceased, as the various
                    projects met
                    their goals.</p>
                <p>When they returned from their final moonbase project, Virgil worked at the Kansas headquarters as chief
                    engineer for Tracy
                    Technologies and John split his time between being a guest lecturer of astronomy at NYU and working in
                    another field
                    of interest, finance, as chief comptroller for Tracy Technologies. Still, John yearned to get back in
                    space. Then one
                    day, to his surprise and delight, his father asked him and his brothers to join him in forming an
                    organization, International
                    Rescue, to save people who would otherwise be beyond aid. Jeff had brought in a genius, Brains, who John
                    had met in astronaut
                    training school, to design the machines they needed. Then Jeff, his brothers, and Brains built
                    everything in secret on
                    Tracy Island. Jeff felt that the organization could not run smoothly unless they remained out of the
                    public eye, and
                    after overcoming some difficulties in their first year of operation, the world generally respected their
                    privacy.</p>
                <p>John found Thunderbird 5 to be a perfect fit for his interests. True, it did get lonely now and then, but
                    every time he looked
                    out that window or used his own private telescope for his research, he felt he was in the place he was
                    destined to be.
                    Even better, the communications satellite satisfied another passion he had nurtured since childhood:
                    radio. Before he
                    turned 21, he had every radio license it was possible to qualify for. Over the years, he had
                    communicated with people
                    all over the world, and spoke several languages fluently. Coordinating communications for International
                    Rescue could
                    not have come more naturally.</p>
                <p>Right now, however, the communications console emitted only normal background chatter. He returned to the
                    astrodome to see
                    if the camera had captured anything further. Settling comfortably into the observation chair, he watched
                    the camera monitor
                    instead of looking through the virtual eyepiece. He did not expect to see anything else, but just to be
                    sure, he backed
                    up the recording to the point where he left and sped through it.</p>
                <p>Something blacked out the star field for an instant, and was gone.</p>
                <p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; Two different objects in one night! John sat up straight in the chair and backed up
                    the recording again.
                    Whatever this was, it was big, near, and fast! When he reached the point in the recording again, he ran
                    it very slowly.
                    He had feared that a giant asteroid was nearing Earth, but the clean lines and flashing lights indicated
                    a space vessel
                    of some sort.</p>
                <p>&#8220;Calling International Rescue!&#8221;</p>
                <p>John touched his earpiece. This ever-present device felt so natural, he often forgot it was on.
                    &#8220;International Rescue,
                    reading you,&#8221; he said as he scrambled out of his seat and hurried to the communications center.
                </p>
                <p>&#8220;This is International Space Control at Glen Allyn Field. We launched our scheduled lunar shuttle
                    earlier today&#8230;&#8221;</p>
                <p>John nodded as he entered the control center. He had seen the shuttle lift off earlier and followed it
                    until it had cleared
                    the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
                <p>&#8220;&#8230;but now we&#8217;ve lost contact with it. Radar from the moonbase shows that it&#8217;s
                    leaving the Earth-Moon
                    system fast. We can&#8217;t get another spacecraft up for hours, and we have nothing that can catch up
                    with it at its
                    current speed. Can you help us?&#8221;</p>
                <p>John took a seat at the control panel. &#8220;We&#8217;re on it, International Space Control. We&#8217;ll
                    be in touch.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;Thank you! I&#8217;ll stand by. Call if you need anything.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;We will.&#8221; John contacted Tracy Island.</p>
                <p>Within seconds, his father&#8217;s face appeared on a monitor screen. Jeff Tracy was 57 years old, with
                    gray hair receding
                    at the temples. His serious expression emphasized his craggy features. &#8220;Go ahead, John.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;Father, the shuttle to the Moon is out of control and headed away from the solar system. I need to
                    take Thunderbird
                    3 out immediately and overtake it.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Alan?&#8221;</p>
                <p>John checked the monitor to Alan&#8217;s room. &#8220;Still sleeping. That flu medicine really knocks you
                    out. He&#8217;ll
                    be okay until I get back.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;Get going, then.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;F.A.B.&#8221; John used International Rescue&#8217;s own acknowledgement code. He pressed more
                    buttons. &#8220;I&#8217;m
                    transferring emergency pick-up to your control station.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;Right, John,&#8221; Jeff said. &#8220;Your brothers and I will monitor the emergency channels
                    while you&#8217;re gone.&#8221;</p>
                <p>&#8220;Leaving now.&#8221; John rushed to the boarding tube, which took him to the Thunderbird 3 control
                    room. After closing
                    the entry hatch, he sat in the pilot&#8217;s seat, strapped in, and fired the retros to ease the rocket
                    out of the docking
                    tube. Once clear of Thunderbird 5, John searched for the moon shuttle using radar. He found it quickly,
                    entered its course
                    and speed into the navigation computer, and plotted an intercept course. Pushing the engines to maximum
                    thrust, Thunderbird
                    3 accelerated rapidly. Within an hour, the moon shuttle appeared on the video screen. John reduced speed
                    to match the
                    shuttle&#8217;s as he drew near.</p>
                <p>&#8220;International Rescue to moon shuttle, do you read?&#8221; He lowered his chin, listening for a
                    response, but there
                    was none. Rechecking the communications console, he confirmed that he had the correct NASA frequency,
                    and that the gain
                    was on maximum. &#8220;International Rescue to moon shuttle, do you read?&#8221; Still no response. He
                    tried some alternate
                    emergency frequencies, but nothing came through there, either.</p>
                <p>Consulting his readouts, he considered his options. The shuttle was a long, thick cylindrical craft with
                    a nose cone at the
                    top, an exhaust port on the other end, and three short narrow fins equally spaced around it near the
                    exhaust port. Nothing
                    came out of the exhaust port; the engines had been shut down. Even so, with no friction in space, it
                    continued on its
                    path out of the solar system at a speed well past escape velocity. In addition, the shuttle spun around
                    a point toward
                    the middle of the vehicle, like a pencil spun on a table.</p>
                <p>John could stop the spinning easily by using grabs to snag a fin, but that might jar the crew inside.
                    They probably had their
                    hands full fighting the centrifugal forces as it was. Instead, he maneuvered Thunderbird 3 close to the
                    shuttle and released
                    puffs of gas from the retros to push against the shuttle&#8217;s direction of spin. It was tricky to
                    keep Thunderbird
                    3 under control, as well as to release the right amount of gas to slow the shuttle&#8217;s spin as
                    gently as possible,
                    but at last, the craft stabilized enough so that he could grab a fin. Then Thunderbird 3 and the moon
                    shuttle sped through
                    space as one unit.</p>
                <p>After setting the autopilot to keep everything stable, John took Thunderbird 3&#8217;s elevator to a
                    lower level and put
                    on a spacesuit. He could only guess as to what had gone wrong with the shuttle, but he grabbed a repair
                    kit about the
                    size of a large suitcase and climbed into the airlock. With the other hand, he held tight to an air gun
                    which would propel
                    him to the shuttle. He opened the airlock door and found himself staring into space. For safety&#8217;s
                    sake, and to
                    facilitate getting back to Thunderbird 3, he hooked one end of a safety line to the fuselage, and the
                    other to his spacesuit.
                    A reel in the middle would feed out as much line as he needed.</p>
                <p>From his past experience in constructing the moonbase, John was familiar with the structure of the moon
                    shuttles. He knew
                    exactly where their airlock was and propelled himself right to it. Once there, he opened the
                    shuttle&#8217;s airlock
                    door. After he stepped inside, he unhooked the line from his spacesuit and fastened it to a ring next to
                    the door. He
                    then closed the door and pressurized the airlock.</p>
                <p>When the door to the interior opened, he found himself facing two astronauts.</p>
