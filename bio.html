                    Around 1962, my food allergies were finally diagnosed. I had avoided all the foods I was allergic to before being officially diagnosed, since they all smelled bad to me. My feeling is that I had food allergies almost from birth. (I had asthma and eczema as a baby.)

                    Star Trek came along in 1966. I was an instant fan. (I also watched other 1960s shows, such as The Man From U.N.C.L.E. I
                    belonged to the David McCallum Fan Club for many years.) In 1969, when I was in high school, I was introduced to fandom

                    Later that year, I joined Weight Watchers and lost the weight I had gained in graduate school. I also went to the World Science Fiction convention in England that year.

                    In the early 1990s, I gathered my fanzines and began to write a Star Trek fan history. I had thought it would take me a
                    summer, but it turned out to take me about 3 years. <em>Boldly Writing</em> was published in 1996, the first FTL Publications
                    book.

                    From 2004 to 2007, I called Granada Ventures/ITV regularly for the purposes of acquiring a license to produce novels based on the Gerry and Sylvia Anderson production, Thunderbirds. The license became effective in November 2007. I wrote six novels in the franchise, published seven (the seventh written by someone else). [Seven novels was the limit I could publish under the license terms.]

                                    The family (my parents, brother - born 1955 - and I) moved to Minnesota in 1958, after Dad's enlistment was over. (He joined the marketing department at Sperry.) We started out in an apartment in Minneapolis.
                                    (I called the apartment building a "little castle." It was a brick building.)

                                    Not long after that, we moved to a new house in Minnetonka, a western suburb of Minneapolis. I had started kindergarten in Minneapolis
                                    at age 4, and transferred to Clear Springs Elementary in Minnetonka after the move.

                                    My second grade teacher put up a bulletin board showing the solar system, and I was immediately fascinated by astronomy.
                                    I checked out every book I could from the local library about astronomy and read it. My interest in science fiction grew
                                    from my interest in astronomy.

                                    Around 1962, my food allergies were finally diagnosed. I had avoided all the foods I was allergic to before being
                                    officially diagnosed, since they all smelled bad to me. My feeling is that I had food allergies almost from birth. (I

                                    In 1967, my family moved about a mile away from our first house in Minnetonka to
                                    another (newly built) house in Minnetonka.

                                    I had grown up in the Methodist Church. At the age of 14, I was baptized at my own request, and confirmed after that.

                                    In 1969, when I was in high school, I was introduced to fandom
                                    by Anthony Tollin, who I met at a high school speech festival. He gave me Ruth Berman's phone number, and as a result, I subscribed to <em>T-Negative</em> and was introduced to the world of <em>Star Trek</em> fanzines.

                                    When I was a senior in high school, my high school German class went to Europe. I graduated from high school in June 1971, and started college at the University of Chicago in September 1971.

                                    I traveled to my first convention, the Detroit Triple Fan Fair, from the University of Chicago. At the convention, I met Gene and Majel Roddenberry in an

                                    Had a health crisis which permanently affected my health for the worse. I lost my job, and had to move back with my parents.

                                    <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> premiered. I was an instant fan. I joined the Patrick Stewart fan club as a result and was a member for many years.
