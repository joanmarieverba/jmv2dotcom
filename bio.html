                    In the 1960s presidential election, I was definitely for JFK, who I had seen on TV (we watched the news during dinner every night). I decided then that I was going to be a Democrat.

                    Around 1962, my food allergies were finally diagnosed. I had avoided all the foods I was allergic to before being officially diagnosed, since they all smelled bad to me. My feeling is that I had food allergies almost from birth. (I had asthma and eczema as a baby.)

                    My second grade teacher put up a bulletin board showing the solar system, and I was immediately fascinated by astronomy. I checked out every book I could from the local library about astronomy and read it. My interest in science fiction grew from my interest in astronomy.

                    Star Trek came along in 1966. I was an instant fan. (I also watched other 1960s shows, such as The Man From U.N.C.L.E. I belonged to the David McCallum Fan Club for many years.) In 1969, when I was in high school, I was introduced to fandom by Anthony Tollin, who I met at a high school speech festival.
