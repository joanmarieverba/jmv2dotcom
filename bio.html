                    Around 1962, my food allergies were finally diagnosed. I had avoided all the foods I was allergic to before being officially diagnosed, since they all smelled bad to me. My feeling is that I had food allergies almost from birth. (I had asthma and eczema as a baby.)

                    My second grade teacher put up a bulletin board showing the solar system, and I was immediately fascinated by astronomy. I checked out every book I could from the local library about astronomy and read it. My interest in science fiction grew from my interest in astronomy.

                    Star Trek came along in 1966. I was an instant fan. (I also watched other 1960s shows, such as The Man From U.N.C.L.E. I belonged to the David McCallum Fan Club for many years.) In 1969, when I was in high school, I was introduced to fandom by Anthony Tollin, who I met at a high school speech festival.

I became an Associate Instructor of Astronomy my second year there. However, I did not receive a graduate degree, and returned to Minnesota, where I took some graduate courses in computer programming at the University of Minnesota.

                    Later that year, I joined Weight Watchers and lost the weight I had gained in graduate school. I also went to the World Science Fiction convention in England that year.
