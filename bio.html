                                    The family (my parents, brother - born 1955 - and I) moved to Minnesota in 1958, after Dad's enlistment was over. (He joined the marketing department at Sperry.) We started out in an apartment in Minneapolis.
                                    (I called the apartment building a "little castle." It was a brick building.)

                                <p>
                                    Not long after that, we moved to a new house in Minnetonka, a western suburb of Minneapolis. I had started kindergarten in Minneapolis
                                    at age 4, and transferred to Clear Springs Elementary in Minnetonka after the move.

                                    In the 1960 presidential election, I was definitely for JFK, who I had seen on TV (we watched the news during dinner
                                    every night). I decided then that I was going to be a Democrat.

                                    My second grade teacher put up a bulletin board showing the solar system, and I was immediately fascinated by astronomy.
                                    I checked out every book I could from the local library about astronomy and read it. My interest in science fiction grew
                                    from my interest in astronomy.

                                    Around 1962, my food allergies were finally diagnosed. I had avoided all the foods I was allergic to before being
                                    officially diagnosed, since they all smelled bad to me. My feeling is that I had food allergies almost from birth. (I
                                    had asthma and eczema as a baby.)

                                    In 1969, when I was in high school, I was introduced to fandom
                                    by Anthony Tollin, who I met at a high school speech festival. He gave me Ruth Berman's phone number, and as a result, I subscribed to <em>T-Negative</em> and was introduced to the world of <em>Star Trek</em> fanzines.

                                    When I was a senior in high school, my high school German class went to Europe. I graduated from high school in June 1971, and started college at the University of Chicago in September 1971.

                                    <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em> premiered. I was an instant fan, especially of the Dr. Julian Bashir character. I was

                                    Around 1993, I gathered my fanzines and began to write a <em>Star Trek</em> fan history. I had thought it would take me a
                                    summer, but it turned out to take me about 3 years. <em>Boldly Writing</em> was published in 1996, the first FTL Publications
                                    book.

                                    In 2004, I went to the San Diego Comic Con. This was my last airplane trip, and the last time I left the state. I have
                                    not been able to travel more than a few hours drive away from home since (due to my health problems).

                                    From 2004 to 2007, I called Granada Ventures/ITV regularly for the purposes of acquiring a license to produce novels
                                    based on the Gerry and Sylvia Anderson production, Thunderbirds. The license became effective in November 2007. I wrote
                                    six novels in the franchise, published seven (the seventh written by someone else). [Seven novels was the limit I could
                                    publish under the license terms.]

                                    since the late 1990s, and built websites with WordPress since 2010, but I felt I needed to learn more about web
