            <p><strong>A teen without a home. A dangerous residence. <br />Can she survive one terrifying night
                        to secure her future?</strong>
            </p>
                <p>
                    Charlene Griffin never thought she'd be without a home. But when she's kicked out on her
                    eighteenth birthday, she has no choice but to sleep inside an ominous Victorian mansion. And with the owner offering the
                    estate to anyone who can spend a full night in the haunted property, Charlene decides to risk life and limb to get off the streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refusing to heed the warnings of those sent running in fear for their lives, Charlene is
                    confident she can last from sunset to sunrise. But she'll need all her wits about her to withstand the hours of terror,
                    because these ghosts are determined to get rid of her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will Charlene outsmart her supernatural foes and make it to dawn?

                    A ghost needs space to haunt, and a teenager kicked out of the house by a mother unable to
                    love, lacking money for a
                    rental, and looking for a safe place to stay doesn't have it to offer. But the haunted house
                    offered to Charlene if she
                    can last the night has lost its original family, driven other would-be claimants out by the
                    aggressive late residents,
                    and Charlene is too determined to give up on the only option she's been able to find.
                    Instead of exorcisms or high-tech
                    spirit guns firing special-effects rays, she tries a simpler method for dealing with ghostly
                    threats: compassion, fueled by stubbornness and courage. Joan Marie Verba's Defying the Ghosts offers the eerie dangers
                    expected of ghosts, but works through to a slime-less conclusion offering an elegant win to both the living and the
                    dead. &mdash;Ruth Berman, Minnesota Fantasy Award recipient, Midwest Book Award winner for <em>Bradamant's Quest</em>

                <p>
                    Defying the Ghosts by Joan Marie Verba tells the suspenseful story of a young woman's creepy night in a
                    haunted house. After her mother kicks her out of her house on her eighteenth birthday, Charlene spends the next few weeks
                    scouting homeless shelters and camping out in the back room of the bookstore where she works. Charlene thinks she
                    might be in luck when she hears of a challenge: anyone who can spend the entire night in the local haunted house gets to
                    keep the house. It seems simple enough, but Charlene will soon risk her life on the most horrifying night of her life
                    as she
                    faces the multiple ghosts who do not want anyone else in their home.<br />
                    &nbsp;<br />
                    For any reader who is looking for a new kind of horror story, Defying the Ghosts is a great choice for both
                    teens and
                    adults. I never knew it was possible to write a book that was simultaneously terrifying and heartwarming,
                    but Joan Marie
                    Verba has flawlessly managed to do just that. Charlene's story is eye-opening and brings to light the
                    everyday problems
                    and prejudices that...people face when they are trying to survive. The spooky moments of the haunted
                    house are
                    fast-paced, suspenseful, and overall fun to read. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time Charlene was
                    in the house,
                    and I could not put the book down. I can't wait to see what other horror tales Verba has in store.

                <p><strong>From the 2003 edition:</strong></p>
                <p>Before the Internet, before PCs and MACs became common household items, at the dawn of the era of VCRs,
                    <em>Star Trek</em> fans were making history. In <em>Boldly Writing</em>, Joan Marie Verba chronicles the
                    development of <em>Star Trek</em> fanfiction,
                    <em>Star Trek</em> conventions (the first <em>Star Trek</em> convention may not be the one you're
                    thinking of), <em>Star Trek</em> clubs, and <em>Star Trek</em>
                    revival efforts. <em>Boldly Writing</em> tells how the term “Mary Sue” came into being, and follows the
                    fan and fanfiction discussions
                    and controversies of the era. At a time when fan communication was conducted largely through the mails,
                    and fanfiction circulated
                    through fanzines printed on spirit duplicators and mimeographs and offset printers, <em>Star Trek</em>
                    fans created a lively and active
                    fandom that continues today.
                </p>
    
                <p><strong>From the 1996 edition:</strong></p>
                <p>When<em>Star Trek</em> began in 1966, it instantly captured the attention of science fiction fans, and
                    gained an attentive audience.
                    When NBC threatened to cancel the show after the second season, the fans wrote in, demanding that it be
                    returned to the
                    air. After the third season, Paramount, NBC, and industry experts felt <em>Star Trek</em> was past. But
                    the fans did not. They started clubs, organized conventions, published newsletters, and
                    kept writing to Paramount to ask that <em>Star Trek</em> be revived. Through these actions, they kept
                    interest in the show alive and flourishing. At last, fan
                    efforts resulted in the<em>Star Trek</em> movies, and <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>.
                    Currently,
                    <em>Star Trek</em> lives on in five series&mdash;and the adventure continues.

                </p><em>Boldly Writing</em> chronicles all of these fan efforts, and recognizes the most valuable resource
                of
                <em>Star Trek</em>: its fans. The trends, obstacles, hard work, and success of the revival efforts are
                detailed through the first
                20 years of fan publications. Author Joan Marie Verba has been an active fan since the very beginning of
                <em>Star Trek</em>, and a zine reader, writer, publisher, and collector since 1969.</p>

                <p>This book pulls together an incredible amount of information about the history of fandom and
                    does a major service for anyone who either wants to relive those exciting years or to better understand
                    how <em>Star Trek</em> emerged
                    as such a national and international phenomenon. I'll give you a clue. If <em>Star Trek</em>
                    <strong>lives</strong>, it's because of what early fans
                    like Verba made of it. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in fandom (which increasingly
                    means anyone interested
                    in popular culture).

                <p>Joan Marie Verba brings back to life the heady days of <em>Star Trek</em> fandom, chronicling the fight
                    to revive the original series and detailing
                    the controversy and the gossip that fueled the first twenty years and gave birth to generations of
                    wonderful poets and writers.
                    I couldn't stop myself from dipping into this fascinating history.</p>
    
                <p><strong>Andrew Robinson, <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em></strong></p>
                <p>Thank you for your <em>Boldly Writing</em>. I found it most informative, especially in light of where
                    [the] <em>Star Trek</em> fanzine
                    is now. It’s come a long way. Congratulations and continued success. </p>

                <p>Yesterday ... the galley proofs to <em>Boldly Writing</em> by Joan Marie Verba arrived in the mail .... I
                    had no idea her fanzine
                    history was such an ambitious work. I advise any <em>Star Trek</em> fan who wasn’t around in 1969 to
                    order a copy .... She has taken
                    the amorphous welter of material that came off the fan presses and revealed a sharp, clear, and most of
                    all, documented, print. She has shown us how <em>Star Trek</em> fandom was a force that gathered
                    in, energized, trained, and produced people who have since then racked up an astounding list of
                    achievements.... I have nothing but praise for this monumental work!”</p>

                            Survivors</em></strong></p>
                <p>Little did I know on September 8, 1966 that watching a new television show would profoundly change my
                    life. <em>Star Trek</em> has been inextricably woven
                    into my existence ever since. In <em>Boldly Writing</em>, Joan Marie Verba chronicles the height of the
                    fanzine phenomenon.... Joan's
                    book is an amazing reminder of all those stories we shared, those dreams we dreamed, as we went where no
                    fandom had gone
                    before.</p>

                        tells of what was known about those planets and their moons before the Voyager missions, as well as what

                        <em>Voyager</em> 1 and 2 in 1977. These flights of exploration greatly expanded our knowledge of the outer
                        planets of the solar
                        system. Verba gives a concise but fairly thorough description of the Voyager project from conception through
                        the completion
                        of the probes' photographic mission.
                        <em>Voyager</em> begins with a brief discussion of the exploration of the solar system prior to the project.
                        . . . Each of the
                        chapters on the outer planets begins by describing what was known before

                        <em>Voyager</em>. . . . The material is appropriate for interested 5th and 6th graders, but the vocabulary
                        level is more at the
                        7th- and 8th-grade level ... this is a good account of the flights of

                <p>The kingdom of Somerlie has been in the grip of the evil overlord Tashtalon for over 500 years. No one has
                    ever seen Tashtalon,
                    but he puts the kingdom to sleep every night, and during the night, people disappear, never to be seen
                    again. Gill has spent
                    her life thinking these things could not possibly by changed, until strange events point her to the only
                    thing that can defeat
                    Tashtalon…a magical weapon called the Sword of Queens. To prevent its use, Tashtalon made a law saying that
                    any woman wielding
                    a sword will be put to death…and he enforces that law savagely. Can Gill summon the courage to find the
                    sword and use it
                    before Tashtalon kills her?</p>

                <p>For over five centuries, Tashtalon the overlord has ruled the patriarchal kingdom of Somerlie with an evil
                    iron fist. No
                    one has ever seen Tashtalon but everyone knows of his presence especially at night when sleeping is
                    dangerous. Each evening,
                    Tashtalon puts his subjects to sleep two hours after sunset; and awakens them each morning two after sunrise
                    with some vanishing
                    overnight. No one has any hope of overthrowing this invincible malevolent God.</p>
                <p> Twentyish Gill is like everyone else living
                    in fear of the evil ruler; wondering if she will disappear next and knowing how helpless it is as nothing
                    can defeat Tashtalon.
                    Gill wonders why the overlord's most enforced law is that no woman will yield a sword with the penalty of
                    breaking his code
                    instant death though she assumes it has to do with females being subservient to males. As she begins her
                    required quest year
                    "To Find Herself", Gill thinks of her elderly grandma's tales of life before Tashtalon. On her journey Gill
                    learns that the
                    magical Sword of Queens can destroy Tashtalon.</p>
                <p> Sword of Queens is an excellent coming of age quest fantasy starring a likable
                    heroine. The vibrant Verba world of magic seems real while the vile villain is made even stronger and eviler
                    by the fearful
                    whispers of his subjects. Sub-genre readers will enjoy Gill's adventures in an engaging good and evil
                    thriller.</p>

                Joan Marie Verba's delightful story, "Wondry Dragon Finds a Home." Rhea and her mom and dad have never had a dragon in the

                what dragons can do. Wondry will surprise young readers ages 6 to 8 as well! A children's chapter book story suitable for

                <p><strong>Previous description:</strong></p>
                <p>The women at Modern Surprises LLC, needed someone to answer the phones. Jay Ecklund was hired. From the very
                    first day, he
                    found this was no ordinary company: the science division there had secretly developed a portal that would
                    allow them to go
                    to anywhere on Earth. Madeline Chang, a military veteran and owner of Modern Surprises, had a plan: to use
                    the portal as a device to help those in need. However, billionaire industrialist Charles Vance found out about the portal,
                    and was willing to lie, cheat, and steal to get it for himself. But Madeline, Jay, and the rest of the team were not about
                    to let him have it.</p>
                <p>A note from the author: if you enjoy television shows that show how science works,
                    <em>Modern Surprises</em> is for you. I definitely had fun with the novel, and intended for the characters
                    to have fun, as well&mdash;because I believe science is fun (I have a physics degree). Through the novel, readers experience how technology
                    needs to be tested, how there are are unexpected effects, and how technology doesn’t always work in the way the original design
                    indicated it might (and that can be delightful). When the characters find that the portal, Arachne, responds to music, it
                    adds yet another dimension to the technology. I hope you’ll have fun with the story, too.

                <p>Modern Surprises [is] a delightful adventure story. This book is tremendous fun, and has a lot of really
                    strong, fascinating
                    characters, most of whom happen to be female. Really groovy stuff, and you should check it out. </p>

                <p>Leah came to Autumn World only to observe. But when her survey ship crashes, and the other survivors, traumatized, run away,
                she finds herself in the midst of a political and religious struggle on an alien world she barely knows.</p>

                <p><strong>Midwest Book Review (Philip E. Kaveny)</strong></p>
                <p>The novel is well-crafted and a very good read with lots sf world-building detail which takes place on a heavier-than-earth-gravity
                planet with some really neat aliens. It is a lot better than 90% of the stuff that you can find on a rack at...the big chain
                bookstores.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Mythprint</em> (Laura Krentz)</strong></p>
                <p> This is a complex and fascinating science fiction story with a well-developed but very alien world. ... Some of the aliens
                are extremely alien compared to humans, though they usually have understandable motivations. The book would appeal to young
                readers as well as adult readers.</p>
