            <p><strong>A teen without a home. A dangerous residence. <br />Can she survive one terrifying night
                        to secure her future?</strong>
            </p>
                <p>
                    Charlene Griffin never thought she’d be without a home. But when she’s kicked out on her
                    eighteenth birthday, she has no
                    choice but to sleep inside an ominous Victorian mansion. And with the owner offering the
                    estate to anyone who can spend
                    a full night in the haunted property, Charlene decides to risk life and limb to get off the
                    streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Refusing to heed the warnings of those sent running in fear for their lives, Charlene is
                    confident she can last from
                    sunset to sunrise. But she’ll need all her wits about her to withstand the hours of terror,
                    because these ghosts are
                    determined to get rid of her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Will Charlene outsmart her supernatural foes and make it to dawn?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Defying the Ghosts</em> is an eerie YA haunted house story. If you like heart-racing
                    action, fearless heroes, and survival
                    adventures, then you’ll love Joan Marie Verba’s thrilling tale.

                    A ghost needs space to haunt, and a teenager kicked out of the house by a mother unable to
                    love, lacking money for a
                    rental, and looking for a safe place to stay doesn’t have it to offer. But the haunted house
                    offered to Charlene if she
                    can last the night has lost its original family, driven other would-be claimants out by the
                    aggressive late residents,
                    and Charlene is too determined to give up on the only option she’s been able to find.
                    Instead of exorcisms or high-tech
                    spirit guns firing special-effects rays, she tries a simpler method for dealing with ghostly
                    threats: compassion, fueled
                    by stubbornness and courage. Joan Marie Verba’s Defying the Ghosts offers the eerie dangers
                    expected of ghosts, but
                    works through to a slime-less conclusion offering an elegant win to both the living and the
                    dead. &mdash;Ruth Berman,

                <p><strong>From the 2003 edition:</strong></p>
                <p>Before the Internet, before PCs and MACs became common household items, at the dawn of the era of VCRs,
                    <em>Star Trek</em> fans were making history. In <em>Boldly Writing</em>, Joan Marie Verba chronicles the
                    development of <em>Star Trek</em> fanfiction,
                    <em>Star Trek</em> conventions (the first <em>Star Trek</em> convention may not be the one you're
                    thinking of), <em>Star Trek</em> clubs, and <em>Star Trek</em>
                    revival efforts. <em>Boldly Writing</em> tells how the term “Mary Sue” came into being, and follows the
                    fan and fanfiction discussions
                    and controversies of the era. At a time when fan communication was conducted largely through the mails,
                    and fanfiction circulated
                    through fanzines printed on spirit duplicators and mimeographs and offset printers, <em>Star Trek</em>
                    fans created a lively and active
                    fandom that continues today.
                </p>
    
                <p><strong>From the 1996 edition:</strong></p>
                <p>When<em>Star Trek</em> began in 1966, it instantly captured the attention of science fiction fans, and
                    gained an attentive audience.
                    When NBC threatened to cancel the show after the second season, the fans wrote in, demanding that it be
                    returned to the
                    air. After the third season, Paramount, NBC, and industry experts felt <em>Star Trek</em> was past. But
                    the fans did not. They started clubs, organized conventions, published newsletters, and
                    kept writing to Paramount to ask that <em>Star Trek</em> be revived. Through these actions, they kept
                    interest in the show alive and flourishing. At last, fan
                    efforts resulted in the<em>Star Trek</em> movies, and <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>.
                    Currently,
                    <em>Star Trek</em> lives on in five series&mdash;and the adventure continues.
                </p>
                </p><em>Boldly Writing</em> chronicles all of these fan efforts, and recognizes the most valuable resource
                of
                <em>Star Trek</em>: its fans. The trends, obstacles, hard work, and success of the revival efforts are
                detailed through the first
                20 years of fan publications. Author Joan Marie Verba has been an active fan since the very beginning of
                <em>Star Trek</em>, and a zine reader, writer, publisher, and collector since 1969.</p>

                            Culture</em></strong></p>
                <p>This book pulls together an incredible amount of information about the history of fandom and
                    does a major service for anyone who either wants to relive those exciting years or to better understand
                    how <em>Star Trek</em> emerged
                    as such a national and international phenomenon. I'll give you a clue. If <em>Star Trek</em>
                    <strong>lives</strong>, it's because of what early fans
                    like Verba made of it. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in fandom (which increasingly
                    means anyone interested
                    in popular culture).

                <p>Joan Marie Verba brings back to life the heady days of <em>Star Trek</em> fandom, chronicling the fight
                    to revive the original series and detailing
                    the controversy and the gossip that fueled the first twenty years and gave birth to generations of
                    wonderful poets and writers.
                    I couldn't stop myself from dipping into this fascinating history.</p>

                <p>Thank you for your <em>Boldly Writing</em>. I found it most informative, especially in light of where
                    [the] <em>Star Trek</em> fanzine
                    is now. It’s come a long way. Congratulations and continued success. </p>

                <p>Yesterday ... the galley proofs to <em>Boldly Writing</em> by Joan Marie Verba arrived in the mail .... I
                    had no idea her fanzine
                    history was such an ambitious work. I advise any <em>Star Trek</em> fan who wasn’t around in 1969 to
                    order a copy .... She has taken
                    the amorphous welter of material that came off the fan presses and revealed a sharp, clear, and most of
                    all, documented, print. She has shown us how <em>Star Trek</em> fandom was a force that gathered
                    in, energized, trained, and produced people who have since then racked up an astounding list of
                    achievements.... I have nothing but praise for this monumental work!”</p>

                <p>Little did I know on September 8, 1966 that watching a new television show would profoundly change my
                    life. <em>Star Trek</em> has been inextricably woven
                    into my existence ever since. In <em>Boldly Writing</em>, Joan Marie Verba chronicles the height of the
                    fanzine phenomenon.... Joan's
                    book is an amazing reminder of all those stories we shared, those dreams we dreamed, as we went where no
                    fandom had gone
                    before.</p>
