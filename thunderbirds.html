            <p>After his wife dies in a tragic accident, astronaut Jeff Tracy is left with five young sons to raise. But
                he turns his grief
                into a dream: to create an organization which will rescue people that no one else can reach. He builds a
                business which creates
                the new technology that the organization will require and earns the billions he needs to finance it. At
                last, he is ready
                to put it all together. He enlists the services of a genius to design aircraft and supporting machinery
                far beyond the standards
                of his time. Together, they find a South Pacific island to use as the base of their operations. Then he
                asks his five sons,
                now grown, to give up promising careers to build the base, operate the machines, and serve in his
                organization. But he finds
                that in order to make his dream a reality, it will require sacrifice, courage, and determination...far
                beyond what he, or
                his sons, ever expected. Can they make International Rescue a reality, and what will it take to make the
                fabulous Thunderbirds
                machines GO?</p>
            <p><strong>Midwest Book Review: Small Press Bookwatch</strong></p>
            <p>Tragedy does strange things to people, and it is not always negative. <em>Countdown to Action!</em> is a
                novel based on the beginnings
                of the old television program Thunderbirds. When faced with his wife's death, Jeff Tracy calls upon his
                sons to create an
                organization dedicated to rescuing those who need it. Creating such an organization, however, is much
                easier said than done.
                <em>Countdown to Action!</em> is highly recommended reading for science fiction enthusiasts in general
                and fans of the Thunderbirds
                television series in particular.

            <p><strong>What readers say about <em>Countdown to Action!</em></strong></p>

            <p><strong>Daria (D.H.) Brooks, author of <em>A Legacy of the Pacific</em></strong></p>
            <p><em>Countdown to Action!</em> [is] a book to read and remember. It's also a thoroughly enjoyable,
                adventurous outing with characters
                who are beloved by fans around the world. The novel begins by filling in an element which has been
                largely neglected in Thunderbirds
                lore as it tells us about the relationship which brought those valiant Tracy brothers into our lives. My
                fascination with
                the series has always been more about what compels this amazing family to risk their lives time and time
                again, as well as
                about what in their collective background prepared them for their hazardous chosen task. Scott, Virgil,
                John, Gordon and
                Alan all had their own fields of study and interests outside of the family and were on their individual
                ways to gaining fame
                in their own right, away from their famous father's shadow. <em>Countdown to Action!</em> illustrates in
                seamless order how Jeff Tracy
                raised five such selfless and brave sons to maturity, gifting the world with young men who were willing
                to sacrifice their
                own personal lives and safety to save those in mortal peril time and time again. Countdown To Action
                successfully delves
                into the formation of the core of International Rescue and so much more, making it a very satisfying
                introduction to an exciting
                new series. </p>

            <p>Thunderbirds has been my inspiration since childhood. This has been an enjoyable read and reliving of the
                characters and
                their history. I look forward to new adventures ahead as should fans old and new, too.</p>
            <p><strong>Doug Pratt, owner, Pratt Hobbies, Herndon, VA</strong></p>
            <p>I encourage you to order copies&mdash;they are wonderful books. If you are new to Thunderbirds, they will
                be an excellent introduction.
                If they Tracy family are old friends, you will find these stories deepen your understanding and enrich
                your memories. That's
                what good books are supposed to do. I'm delighted to have the chance to spread this fine work around,
                and to share something
                that has been very important to me. Something in the program resonated. The idea of selfless, honorable
                people devoting their
                lives to rescuing strangers, maybe. Or maybe it was the technology; nothing in Thunderbirds is what it
                appears to be. Swimming
                pools are rocket hangars, cars have machine guns, watches and powder compacts communicate with
                satellites. And Joan, I have
                to tell you, I've given away 18 books...so far. I'm getting emails back already about how much people
                are enjoying them.
                At least three parents told me they took the books out of the packages and read them before [giving them
                to their children
                to read].</p>
            <p><strong>Monica Ferris, USA Today bestselling author of <em>Crewel World</em> and other Needlecraft
                    Mysteries St. Louis Park, MN</strong></p>
            <p>Verba has created a humane and human background for these characters, with foibles and weaknesses
                believably overcome, which
                makes their forming a brave, self-sacrificing force all the more credit-worthy.  FAB!</p>
            <p><strong>Darlene J. McCurdy, Harrisburg, PA</strong></p>
            <p>I have read the 3 books from the Thunderbird series and can honestly say once I read the first page I
                couldn't put it down.
                It kept me wanting more and looking forward to the next book in the series.  Anyone who loves action
                books, would love the
                Thunderbirds Books.  They are great for kids and adults. I passed them on to my grandson and he loves
                them also.</p>
            <p><strong>Vickie Vanderpool, Indianola, IA</strong></p>
            <p>My grandson loved your second novel.  It took him only a week to read through it. He wanted me to drop
                you a line and say
                "WELL DONE."  After he finished I read it to his younger brothers and he sat in to listen again.
                Amazing; he doesn't sit
                still very often. I see that you'll have a new one coming in 2010. Fantastic!!!!!! We can't wait to read
                this one also.</p>

            <p>All the Tracys are dedicated men of action, and Scott Tracy is no exception! The eldest of Jeff Tracy's
                sons, Scott pilots
                the rocket-reconnaissance aircraft, Thunderbird 1. First to arrive at any disaster scene, he evaluates
                the situation and
                coordinates the team's rescue strategy on site. Due to the importance of Thunderbird 1 to International
                Rescue's operation,
                Scott is present for nearly every rescue mission. Nonetheless, even Scott has his limitations, and in
                Action Alert, he stretches
                himself to those very limits. Can he do so without consequences to himself and International Rescue?</p>

            Virgil Tracy, the second of Jeff Tracy's sons, pilots the heavy-rescue craft, Thunderbird 2, which carries
            the specialized
            rescue equipment to the danger zone. In addition to his expertise as a pilot and engineer, Virgil is also a
            talented pianist
            and artist. Virgil's calm disposition serves him well in the extreme hazards that he faces as a member of
            International Rescue.
            In Deadly Danger, Virgil will have to draw on all of these skills to meet the challenges he faces: a
            California wildfire,
            a mine disaster in South Africa, a volcano eruption in the Pacific, an airliner in trouble, a town in Peru
            in danger of vanishing
            into a sinkhole, a bridge collapse in India, explorers in danger of grinding ice in the Antarctic. Most of
            all Virgil and
            his brothers and associates must find a warped genius who will stop at nothing to build and deploy a fleet
            of advanced machines
            to prove he is the greatest rocket scientist of the 2060s.

            <p><strong>Midwest Book Review: Small Press Bookwatch</strong></p>
            <p>"Thunderbirds: Deadly Danger" is another novel of science fiction based on the famous television series
                as the Tracy family
                is again faced off with evil as a mad rocket scientist threatens the world to prove he is the most
                skilled at his trade
                the world has ever known. Jeff Tracy must stop this madman before he threatens lives even further,
                making International
                Rescue's job ever more difficult. "Thunderbirds: Deadly Danger" is a choice pick for fans of the series
                or simply young
                science fiction fans.</p>
            <p><strong>David Tremont, Model maker, Weta Workshop, New Zealand</strong></p>
            <p>The third in the series, this story is just as fresh and exciting as the first two. The rescues,
                situations, and characters
                all include new things while remaining true to the feel of the Thunderbirds we remember. Read this book
                to your children,
                then show them the original: they, too, will become fans.</p>

                John discovers a new planetary system and realizes its gravity has sent meteors and comets hurtling
                toward Earth. John and
                the rest of the International Rescue team find that this is only the beginning of the disasters they
                must handle, which affect
                them as well as the rest of the world. Can they save the Earth, and themselves, from catastrophe?</p>

            <p>In <em>Situation: Critical,</em> Joan Marie Verba pits International Rescue against a plausible natural
                disaster&mdash;meteor and
                comet fragments careening toward Earth&mdash;and delivers an exciting and suspense-filled yarn that
                stands alongside the best
                episodes from the classic Thunderbirds TV series. </p>

            <p>The Thunderbirds captured the imaginations of many young television viewers decades ago, and now they can
                once more for a
                new generation. "Thunderbirds: Situation: Critical" follows John Tracy and Thunderbird 5 as he finds a
                planetary system
                that is hurtling meteors towards earth and may be a sampling of the disasters that are to come. Another
                exciting short
                novel for young adult readers following the adventures of International Rescue, "Thunderbirds:
                Situation: Critical" is
                a choice pick for science fiction collections.</p>
            <p><strong>David Tremont, Model maker, Weta Workshop, New Zealand</strong></p>
            <p>This is an exciting adventure and close to my heart, having plenty of astronomy&mdash;a story that could
                carry on into further
                books. It is great to see John getting a more prominent part. These stories continue to get more and
                more exciting and further
                expand the Thunderbirds universe. I look forward to new adventures.</p>

            <p>Gordon Tracy, aquanaut, weapons expert, and fun-loving fourth son of Jeff Tracy, learns of a missile that
                can destroy an
                International Rescue aircraft. While working on a way to defeat that, the team discovers an even greater
                menace: plans for
                a bomb that could destroy the Earth have been lost. Unless International Rescue finds those plans, they
                could fall into the
                hands of criminals, who could build such a device and use it for their own ends. Can International
                Rescue retrieve the plans
                and save the planet from certain destruction?</p>

            <p>Alan Tracy, the youngest of the Tracy sons, has always worked to distinguish himself as a member of the
                International Rescue
                team. Now his goals are put to the test as he faces challenges that cause him to evaluate his role in
                the organization, and
                at the same time, strengthen his relationship with the love of his life, Tin-Tin. Can Alan maintain his
                balance with home,
                job, romance, and race car driving? And what about the mysterious golden aircraft that seems to have
                appeared out of nowhere
                and captured the team’s attention?</p>
            <p><strong>David Tremont, Model maker, Weta Workshop, New Zealand</strong></p>
            <p>Even being part of a distinguished organization does not take away normal dreams and passions, and thus
                in defying his father,
                Alan takes Tin-Tin and the rest of the team on an adventure they believe in enough to risk all with
                International Rescue.
                For Alan and Tin-Tin the challenges are great, but the personal gains will become far greater. This is
                another unique adventure
                with International Rescue, addressing a few of their personal issues only lightly hinted at in the TV
                series and revealing
                a more serious side of this dedicated family.</p>

            <p>For his entire life, Alan Tracy
                has been the 'baby brother' of the Tracy clan. In Danger Zone, he is forced to take on a more mature
                role on the valiant
                International Rescue team. In the process, a series of exciting events give Alan pause to ponder his
                future as a rescue hero and race car driver. Will the future he dreams of also include Tin-Tin, IR's talented engineer...? </p>
